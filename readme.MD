# 31474

This repository showcases that `<3.13` works correctly in that Renovate uses `3.12.6` to update Poetry lockfiles as opposed to the issue with https://github.com/jvmdc/PythonProject1

The PR with no lock-file issue at https://github.com/jvmdc/PythonProject2/pull/2 is the equivalent to the failing one at https://github.com/jvmdc/PythonProject1/pull/3
